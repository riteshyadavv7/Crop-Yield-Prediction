Crop yield prediction is an essential predictive analytics technique in the agriculture industry. It is an agricultural practice that can help farmers and farming businesses predict crop yield in a particular season when to plant a crop, and when to harvest for better crop yield. 
Through this machine learning project, we predict crop yields at a country level. Crop yield prediction is a crucial task for agricultural planning, resource allocation, and food security initiatives. By the use of machine learning, we can leverage historical data, weather patterns, and other relevant features to develop accurate predictive models.
